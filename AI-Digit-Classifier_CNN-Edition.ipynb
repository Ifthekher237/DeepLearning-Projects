    "In this notebook, we're going to code a CNN. A convolutional neural network to classify handwritten digits. In another project, we coded up a feedforward neural network to classify handwritten digits.There, we flattened the image out all of the pixels. So we had 28 by 28 pixels flattened out, and each pixel was a feature. And then we had some hidden layers. We built a neural network with three hidden layers to classify this handwritten digit.\n",

    "#### Here's a concise explanation for each step:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:** The network takes as input grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **First Convolutional Layer:** This initial layer consists of eight filters that scan the input image to detect simple patterns, like edges and corners.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Max Pooling:** After the first convolution, max-pooling is applied to reduce the dimensions of the feature maps while retaining essential information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Second Convolutional Layer:** A more complex layer with 32 filters is employed to capture higher-level features, like shapes and textures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Max Pooling:** Similar to the first pooling layer, this reduces dimensions further and keeps critical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **First Fully Connected Layer:** This layer flattens the max-pooled feature maps and connects them to 600 neurons, allowing for more advanced feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Second Fully Connected Layer (Classification):** The final layer consists of 10 neurons, each corresponding to a digit (0-9). It classifies the input image into one of these ten categories, completing the digit recognition process."

Data normalization makes sure that the data has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, which can help with training stability and convergence. "

    "At first we'll make our image completely white background and black digit(foreground) so that there are no other color present in the image but since our model is trained with image of black background and white digit so we'll convert the image to such type of image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Thresholding:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Thresholding is a technique used in image processing to create a binary image, which means that each pixel in the resulting image can be one of two values, typically 0 (black) or 255 (white). It's a way to segment an image into regions or objects based on pixel intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. cv2.threshold Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The **cv2.threshold** function in the OpenCV library is used to perform thresholding.\n",
    "   - It takes several arguments:\n",
    "        - **image**: The input image you want to threshold.\n",
    "        - **127**: The threshold value. This value is used to separate pixels into two groups: those below the threshold and those equal to or above the threshold.\n",
    "        - **255**: The maximum value assigned to pixels that pass the threshold. In this case, pixels with values greater than or equal to 127 become 255 (white).\n",
    "        - **cv2.THRESH_BINARY**: The type of thresholding. This option specifies that if a pixel value is greater than or equal to the threshold (127), it becomes the maximum value (255); otherwise, it becomes the minimum value (0, which is black).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Output of Thresholding:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - After thresholding, you obtain a new image called thresholded, where pixels in regions of interest are set to 255 (white), and background pixels are set to 0 (black).\n",
    "   - Pixels below the threshold (less than 127) are set to 0, and pixels equal to or above the threshold (greater than or equal to 127) are set to 255.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Creating the Image Negative:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - To invert the colors of the binary image, the code calculates the image negative.\n",
    "   - It subtracts the thresholded image from 255, effectively turning the black regions (background) to white and the white regions (digits or objects of interest) to black.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Suppose you have a grayscale image represented as a 2D array like this:\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "  100 & 150 & 200 \\\\\n",
    "  50 & 120 & 80 \\\\\n",
    "  170 & 210 & 90 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "Using the **cv2.threshold** function with a threshold of 127 and **cv2.THRESH_BINARY**, the result would be:\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "  255 & 255 & 255 \\\\\n",
    "  0 & 255 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "  255 & 255 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "In the resulting binary image, values above the threshold (127) become 255 (white), and values below the threshold become 0 (black).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to create the image negative, you would subtract this image from 255, resulting in:\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "  0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "  255 & 0 & 255 \\\\\n",
    "  0 & 0 & 255 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\n",
    "**cv2.waitkey(0)**: pauses the program's execution, waiting for user input, and it will wait indefinitely until a key is pressed by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**cv2.destroyAllwindows()**: This function is used to close all open OpenCV windows, ensuring that any displayed windows are properly closed before the program exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**img = Image.fromarray(img)** this line converts the image from a NumPy array (representing pixel values) into a PIL (Python Imaging Library) image (as this is the required image format for PyTorch)\n",
    "to pass it through the transformation: **transforms_photo(img)** because later we'll provide it to PyTorch model."
